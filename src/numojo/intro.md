# NuMojo

NuMojo is a library for numerical computing in Mojo, similar to NumPy and SciPy in Python. [Link to the repo](https://github.com/Mojo-Numerics-and-Algorithms-group/NuMojo).

I will discuss the conceptual models of the NDArray and how the functionalities are implemented internally.

Some of the functionalities are not yet fulfilled due to Mojo, e.g., parameterized traits. We will incorporate them once they are ready.
